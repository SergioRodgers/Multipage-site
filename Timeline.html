          <p> This was the year that one of the best Battle Royales games of all time was released. The game imm Talking about is Call of Duty Warzone. After the release of Modern Warfare 2019 Activition decided to make one of the best decisions they coulve done. and that is the release of Warzone. From the start Warzone was amazing and everyone loved the game. Until hackers got into the game. Because of all the hackers Warzone lost alot of Gamers a Streamers. Activition banned alot of acounts but theres still noo anticheat and the hacking problem has made Warzone unplayerable. Hopefully Activition can get an Anticheat ASAP.  </p>
